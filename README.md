This repository is the home page for members who work as a substitute of mandatory military service at NICE P&I. The key functions of this home page are as follows: 1. How many days remain until the end of the military service, what anniversary dates are (e.g. birthdays of memebers), and so on 2. You can make a vote and review of nearby restaurants. (I named it Military Guides) 3. Visualize the debt relationship between members 4. You can see pictures of the members 5. Write your opinion to upgrade the homepage
