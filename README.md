# TIMES MILITARY

This repository is the home page for members who work as a substitute of mandatory military service at NICE P&I. 

The key functions of this home page are as follows: 
1. How many days remain until the end of the military service, what anniversary dates are (e.g. birthdays of members) and so on 
2. Make a vote and leave comments on nearby restaurants (I named it "Military Guides")
3. Visualize the debt relationship between members 
4. See pictures of the members 
5. Write opinions to upgrade the homepage
